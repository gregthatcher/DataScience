Overfitting (model is unable to generalize to new data):
    Check if validation data accuracy is worse than train data accuracy.
    Check if test data accuracy is worse than train data accuracy.

    Mitigate by:
        1.) Adding more (rows of) data
            a.) Data Augmentation
                Create additional data by modifying old data
                (e.g. flipping, rotating, cropping images)
        2.) Reduce complexity of model
            (e.g. reduce # of layers or # of neurons)
        3.) (Increase) Dropout (Regularization)

Underfitting:
    training accuracy is low (loss is high)
    1.) Add more features to training set (if we can)
    2.) Increase complexity of model
        (e.g. more neurons or more layers)
    3.) Reduce Dropout (Regularization)
        a good indicator for this is if training metrics are worse 
        than validation metrics.

Training too slow:
    1.) Consider weight initialization
