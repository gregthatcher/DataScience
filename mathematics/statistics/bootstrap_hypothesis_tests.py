# 1.) Clearly state null hypothesis
# 2.) Define test statistic
# 3.) Generate many sets of simulated data using null hypothesis
# 4.) Compute the value of the test statistic for each simulated data set
# 5.) The p-value is the fraction of simulated data sets for which
#           the test statistic is at least as extreme as for the real data.

# One sample test - compare one set of data to a single number
# Two sample test - compare two sets of data
